    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        onion and mushrooms; season with salt
        <br />
        Cook and stir until mushrooms release all of their liquid and start to
        brown, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bell pepper and jalapeño pepper. Cook and stir until peppers begin
        to soften, about 5 minutes.
        <br />
        Season with cumin, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. Cook
        and stir to blend the flavors, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomatoes and water. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer uncovered,
        stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened
        <br />
        and sweet, 15 to 20 minutes. Add more water if sauce becomes too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a large spoon to make a depression in sauce for each egg. Crack an
        egg into a small ramekin and slide gently into an
        <br />
        indentation; repeat with remaining eggs. Season eggs with salt and
        pepper. Cover and cook until eggs reach desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>Top with feta cheese and parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>
